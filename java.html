<h1>Java</h1>
<h3 id="header">1. Variables</h3>
<p>Variables are the backbone of most coding languages. In Java, there are 5 types of variables:
<br>int: int stands for integer, and can store a number from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. This limit is because ints are 32 bits, so it can only store a certain value, and 2,147,483,647 happens to be that value for 32 bits.
<br>double: double is a decimal value, and it pretty similar to an int.
<br>String: a String is a word, and is declared using quotations ("").
<br>boolean: a boolean is holds a true or false value, and is commonly used for "if statements".
<br>char: a char is like a String, except it uses single quotes instead (''). It stores a single character.
<h4 id="header">How to declare a variable:</h4>
<p>To declare a variable, you first have to state what type it is. Here are examples:</p>
<p id="code">int myInt = 5;
    <br>double myDouble = 5.0;
    <br>String myString = "Hello World!";
    <br>boolean myBoolean = true;
    <br>char myChar = 'a';
</p>
Now, you can use these variables in your code. In this example, we print them out.
<p id="code">
    System.out.println(myInt);
    <br>System.out.println(myDouble);
    <br>System.out.println(myString);
    <br>System.out.println(myBoolean);
    <br>System.out.println(myChar);
</p>
</p>
<h3 id="header">2. Running your code</h3>
<p>To run your code you need a main method, inside of a class. Here is an example of a Main class, with a main method:
<p id="code">
    public class Main {
    <br>public static void main(String[] args) {
        <br>// Your code goes here
        <br>}
    <br>}
</p>
classes and methods will be discussed later, along with other aspects of this code. For now, all you need to know is that.
